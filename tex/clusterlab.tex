Youwill then explore environments of typical galaxies in random fields(called {\it field galaxies}) and galaxies in groups and clusters. Thekey lesson of this exercise will be that galaxies in clusters aresystematically different than galaxies in random fields: namely,clusters contain unusual concentrations of bright galaxies and amost galaxies in a cluster have similar colors and are redder than typical galaxies in the field . You will see that this fact can be used to searchfor clusters on the sky using galaxy colors and you will carry outsuch search based on what you learn in the first half of the lab.In the final part of the lab you will estimate total gravitational mass of a cluster using the virial theorem and compare it to the total mass associated with its galaxies. You will see that the two massesare vastly different, thereby recovering one of the oldest and strongest observational evidence for the existence of {\it dark matter} in the universe, which was originally obtained by US astrophysicists Fritz Zwicky and Sinclair Smith in the mid-1930s using very similar method to what you will use. \section*{Galaxy clustering}As noted above, galaxies tend to {\it cluster} on the scales of the orderof mean separation between galaxies. We can quantify this tendency by comparing the number of galaxies within a certain angular radius of another galaxy and compare it to the number expected if galaxieswere distributed uniformly on the sky. For this exersize we can use the random fields used in the Hubble labto perform galaxy counts reuse your previous counts or you can choose a random field within the sky area covered by the SDSS survey yourself. Load the SDSS Galaxy Querykml plugin from the directory showed to you by TA and activate the\texttt{SDSS Galaxy Photometric Layer} by checking the box next to it, make surethe \texttt{SDSS Galaxy Spectroscopic Layer} is turned off (byunchecking it). Zoom in on a random field of 5 arcminutes accross (the sizeis indicated in the lower right corner of the Sky window). Count galaxies within the fields identified by the photometric plugin (galaxies with circles). To estimate the mean separation between galaxies on the sky, we need to estimate their mean density: $\bar{n}=N/A$, where $N$ is the number of galaxies in the area and $A$ is the area, which we will compute in arcminutessquared (arcmin$^2$). To measure the area of the viewing window, use the ruler icon in the icon bar at the top of the Sky window. Once you click on the rulericon, a window and a target box will pop up. Bring cursor to one edge of the viewingarea and click, then bring the cursor to the opposite edge (you will see the line stretching after the cursor, make sure the line is horizonthal or vertical, dependingon which side of the viewing rectangle you are measuring) then click when the cursorreaches the edge. The ruler window will report the angular distance between the two points (i.e., the length of the stretched line) in degrees (recall that 1 degree isequal to 60 arcminutes). Compute the area of the viewing window rectangle in arcminutessquared usingyour measurements and the mean density of galaxies in your area. You can reusethe counts from the previous lab for other fields to estimate the mean numberof galaxies better. \\[2mm]{\bf Lab tasks.} {\it\begin{itemize}\item Estimate the mean density of galaxies with SDSS photometry, $\bar{n}$, (identified by circlesby the photometric plugin). Report the number and the details of calculations used to obtain it. \item Estimate the mean angular distance between galaxies used in the countsby taking an inverse cube root of the mean density: $\bar{d}=\bar{n}^{-1/3}$.Report this number as well. \item Choose one of the galaxies used in estimating of $\bar{d}$ and zoom-in on it to the zoom level (number in right bottom corner) equal to $2\bar{d}$ (be careful to estimate the number in the same units, the scale in thecorner is given in arcminutes and arcseconds). Count the number of the circled galaxies within the regions. Then zoom-out to the original view, choose another galaxy and repeat. Perform such counts for a dozen galaxies orso. \item How many galaxies do you usually find when you zoom-in to $2\bar{d}$?Is this consistent with what you expect for a uniform distribution?  \end{itemize}}\section*{Galaxy luminosities and colors in different environments}We will first explore galaxies in the typical random field (called ``field galaxies''). Make sure the \texttt{SDSS Galaxy Query plugin} used in the previous part is stillactivated and it identifies galaxies with circles, and activate the \texttt{Color-Magnitude plugin}, which plots the $r$-band apparent magnitude ($x$-axis) and colors (differencein apparent magnitude in $g$ and $r$ filters, in the $y$-axis) of galaxies in the fieldin the graph in the top left corner of the field of view. This plot is called {\it the color-magnitude diagram\/} (CMD). You can use one of the random fields used before, or choose your own. Zoom on the fieldto the scale of about 15 arcminutes or so (number in the lower right corner).\\[2mm] {\bf Lab tasks.} {\it\begin{itemize}\item Describe how galaxies in the random fields are distributed in the CMD. \item Load {\tt Groups} location file and examine CMD around galaxy groups (small groupingsof galaxies. Describe any difference you notice from the CMD distribution of galaxies inthe random fields. \item Load {\tt Clusters} location file and describe the distribution of galaxies in the CMDsand the differences from random and group locations. \item Zoom-in onto the region around the brightest cluster galaxies (say central 5 arcminutes) andexamine the CMD of galaxies in this region. Now zoom-out, center on a region in the outskirts of the cluster (say 20-30 arcminutes away from the BCG), zoom-in to 5 arcminute level again and examineCMD. How does the distribution of galaxies changes when you move to theoutskirts of clusters?\item Examine clusters at different redshifts (you can get the redshift by clicking on thebrightest galaxy near the center of each cluster). How does the distribution of galaxies change in the CMD for clusters at higher redshifts?\item Discuss and interpret your results in terms of what you learned about propertiesof galaxies in nearby clusters and what you know about spectra of red elliptical galaxies. \end{itemize}}\section*{Hunting for clusters}In the previous section you should have learned that cluster fieldscontain unusual concentration of bright galaxies which look moreyellow (``redder'') than most field galaxies. Galaxies in clustersform a horizonthal ``ridge'' or ``sequence'' in the color-magnitudediagram. In this portion of the lab you will use this fact to carryout a ``blind'' search for galaxy clusters in the sky. This method ofsearching for clusters, done in an automated and systematic way usinga computer analysis of images, was pioneered just ten years ago by theUniversity of Chicago Prof. Michael Gladders (among others) and is themost efficient way of finding new clusters using the optical imagesand multi-band photometry (measurements of apparent magnitudes ofgalaxies through different filters).To perform the search, go to a random field on the sky (you can go to oneof the random fields used above or choose a random area on the sky yourself, just make sure you are well within the SDSS coverage). Zoom-in (or zoom-outdepending on the inital zoom of your view) to the level at which the marker in the lower right hand corner of the Sky view windowshows approximately 15 arcminutes (i.e., $0^{\circ}15^{'}...$). Once you choosethe zoom level, keep it the same throughout the exercise (you can play with itonce you find a cluster). Now turn off (uncheck) the \texttt{imagery layer} in the bottom liston the panel on the left hand side of the Sky window.  This should getrid of the SDSS image of the sky, leaving a gray uniform backgroundwith the CMD diagram remaining. Now scan the sky making $\approx15^{'}$ steps.  You can do this, for example, by clicking on the leftmost edge of the field of view and dragging it all the way to theright (or, similarly, from the bottom to top). The order or direction of your stepsis not very important, but it may make sense to do them in one direction once you choseit. Please count the number of steps you take (thereby roughly estimating thearea you scan to find a cluster). If you stumble onto an area which may credibly look like it contains acluster, you can try to make smaller shifts about the center of thefield of view to see if it makes cluster signature in the CMD morepronounced. If you believe you may have found a cluster, turn the\texttt{imagery} layer back on and scan the field of view visually. Ifit looks like there is a cluster in particular area, zoom on it andexamine to make sure (hint: look for large, bright elliptical galaxiesin the field of view similar to the brightest cluster galaxies you've examined in theHubble lab; these are candidates for cluster centers which you can examine by zooming in on their locations). If you are not sure there is a cluster after visualinspection, consult with the TA, or simply continue searching for amore obvious case. Once you find the cluster, you are ready for\\[2mm]{\bf Lab tasks.} {\it\begin{itemize}\item Estimate the rough area you surveyed to find a cluster. How many such clusters per square degree of the sky would you then expect? How rare are clusters based on your measurements (how many would there by in the entire sky; the entire sky has the area of approximately $41253$ square degrees)?\item Turn on the {\tt SDSS Galaxy Query} layer (uncheck the {\tt Photometric Layer}, makesure the {\tt Spectroscopic layer} is turned on. Find galaxies with SDSS spectra, look forthe spectra of the brightest galaxies in the cluster area. Find the approximate redshiftof the cluster. \item Examine galaxies with SDSS spectra in the area. Do all of them have similar redshifts. If not all, why not?\item Turn of the CMD layer, zoom-out to view larger than $15^{'}$ accross. Examineredshifts of galaxies with SDSS at larger distances from the brightest cluster galaxies. Try to find the most distant galaxy from the BCG which still has redshift similar to thatof the BCG. Measure the angular distance between BCG and the most distant galaxy using the rulericon. Quote the number --- this will be your rough estimate of the cluster extent. \item Identify several (the more, the better but not more than 10) galaxies within extent of the cluster with redshifts close to thatof the BCG. Record their redshifts and calculate the mean redshift of the cluster usingtheir individual redshifts. \item Using the angular extent measured above and the estimated redshift of the cluster, compute the actual physical extent of the cluster in Mpc corresponding to the angular extentassuming the Hubble constant value of $H_0=70$~km/s/Mpc. \end{itemize}}\section*{Measuring cluster mass using Virial Theorem}If, in the previous section of the lab, you found a nearby cluster ($z\sim 0.0.05-0.15$) with at least five member galaxies that had spectra and similar redshifts to that of the BCG, you can usethe cluster you found to measure its mass using the virial theorem in this section. If the clusteryou found is at higher redshift and/or does not have enough galaxies with measured spectra, you canuse one of the systems in the {\tt Clusters} list used above to examine cluster environments. In the latter case, you have to redo the exercise of estimating cluster extent on the sky andconverting it into physical extent in megaparsecs. Once the cluster is chosen, center the field of view on the BCG and adjust zoom so that the field of viewencompasses the entire extent of the cluster. Identify cluster members (i.e., galaxies with SDSS spectra andmeasured redshifts similarto that of the BCG) among galaxies identified with a circle with the SDSS Galaxy Spectroscopic plugin. Record the redshifts of the member galaxies and calculate the mean redshift of the cluster. To estimate cluster mass, you will use the so-called {\it virial theorem}. This theorem relates the kinetic, $K$, and potential, $W$, energies of the system and applies to any self-gravitating system in equilibrium (e.g. it also applies to the Sun, Earth, stellar clusters, etc.): \begin{equation}W=-2K.\label{eq:VT}\end{equation}The kinetic energy of a cluster is \begin{equation}K\approx \frac{1}{2}M_{\rm tot}\langle v_{\rm gal}^2 \rangle, \label{eq:KE}\end{equation}where $M_{\rm tot}$ is the {\it total} gravitating mass of a cluster (which we aim to measure) and $\langle v_{\rm gal}^2\rangle$ is characteristic velocity disperson of cluster material. We will estimate the latter by using dispersion of velocities of the cluster member galaxies about the mean cluster velocity, which can be calculated as\begin{equation}\langle v^2_{\rm gal} \rangle \equiv 3\,{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm gal}} (cz_i-c\bar{z})^2\over N-1}= 3c^2\,\times\,{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm gal}} (z_i)^2 - N_{\rm gal}\bar{z}^2\over N_{\rm gal}-1}. \label{eq:disp}\end{equation}The factor of 3 in front is to account for the fact that redshifts measure only velocityalong the line of sight, while virial theorem applies to velocities along all three dimensions of space; $\bar{z}$ is the mean redshift of the cluster you measured using the $N_{\rm gal}$ galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts $z_i$, which you have recorded in the previous step. The potential energy of the self-gravitating system of mass $M_{\rm tot}$ is negative by definition and is given by\begin{equation}W=-\alpha \frac{GM_{\rm tot}^2}{R},\label{eq:PE}\end{equation}where $\alpha$ is a numeric factor of order unity which depends on how mass is distributed within the system, $R$ is the physical extent of the system, and $G=6.6726\times 10^{-8}\,\,\rm cm^3\, s^{-2}\,g^{-1}$ (in cgs units) is the universal gravitationalconstant. For the mass distribution expected in clusters $\alpha\approx 0.5$ (good assumptionfor the accuracy of your measurement which will be to a factor of two or so), and we will use this number to compute the mass. Combining equations~\ref{eq:VT}, \ref{eq:KE}, and \ref{eq:PE} we get: \begin{equation}M_{\rm tot}=\frac{R\langle v^2_{\rm gal} \rangle}{\alpha G}.\label{eq:M}\end{equation}\\[2mm]{\bf Lab tasks:} {\it \begin{itemize}\item Using your tabulated redshifts $z_{i}$ of galaxy members calculate the mean redshift $\bar{z}$ and $\langle v^2_{\rm gal}\rangle$ in km/s. \item Use equation~\ref{eq:M} to estimate total mass of the cluster within the extent you measured. $R$ is half the cluster diameter that you measured and take $\alpha=0.5$. Be careful with units and give the result in solar masses $M_{\odot}$ (where $M_{\odot}=1.989\times 10^{33}$~g). \item Count the number of red bright galaxies around the cluster within $R$ (with or without spectra) to get a rough number of cluster galaxies. Each of such bright galaxies has total mass in starsof about $10^{11}\,\rm M_{\odot}$ (give or take a factor of 2-3). This number is determinedfrom luminosities of these galaxies and average luminosity and mass of old starswhich these galaxies consist of. Estimate roughly the total massin stars within $R$ using the number of galaxies you counted and the average stellar massof $10^{11}\,\rm M_{\odot}$. How does this mass compare to the total mass $M_{\rm tot}$ you calculatedusing the virial theorem? How big is the difference?\end{itemize}}The difference between mass in stars and total mass is one of the pieces of observationalevidence we have for existence of large amounts of dark gravitating matter in the universe on large scales. Actually, in clusters there are large amounts of hot plasma mostly consisting of hydrogen and heliumnuclei and electrons, but the mass of this plasma measured from its X-ray emission still falls far shortof explaining the measurements of total cluster masses. \end{document}
